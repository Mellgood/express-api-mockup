# API Mockup app

This is intended to be used like a sketch to implement simple API services. I will expand basic mock functionalities as soon as I will need them in real projects.

## Purpose

This is a fast and minimal setup for a backbone nodejs-based using express framework, mongoose and dotenv.

## Before use

Create your .env file and fill it with your DB_CONNECTION variable

```File
DB_CONNECTION=mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<YOUR-DATABASE>
```

## ToDo

- Add JWT support
- ...
